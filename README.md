* Also, you can mark everything as "Completed" or "Active" by clicking the appropriate button.

* You can easily delete your todos by clicking on the delete button next to the todo or by clicking "Clear completed" to delete all completed todos.

* You can easily switch between "Active", "Completed" or "All" todos.

* If you make a mistake in writing a todo, you can double-click on it with the left mouse button and change it (for changes to be applied, you need to press "Enter" or click on an empty area of the page).

* To cancel the change, use the "Escape" button. Also, if you have an empty field when changing the task, the task will be deleted.
